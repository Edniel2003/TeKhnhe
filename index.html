          <p><strong>Group 3 of research wants to give the privilege of 11th and 12th grade programming a website that they can access that has relevancy. This website is designed to provide resources, tools, and information that support and enhance their learning experience. A relevant website for Group 3 programming students is to be designed to complement and support their classroom learning experience, providing them with the resources and tools they need to excel in their studies and prepare for further studies in computer science or a career in the programming field. One way to ensure that the website remains up-to-date is by incorporating open-source libraries, which are constantly evolving and improving. This would allow the website to integrate the latest developments in technology and programming into its resources and tools. Another way to maintain the relevance of the website is by encouraging community contributions and feedback. Since the website is based on an open-source library, it can be modified and improved by anyone with the necessary expertise. By allowing users to contribute to the website's content, the website can remain current and relevant to the needs of its users.</strong></p>
